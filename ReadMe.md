# 🤖 Smart FAQ Bot using Streamlit

A beginner-level **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project built with **Python** and **Streamlit** that answers user questions based on a custom FAQ dataset. It also supports **voice input**, editable FAQs, and a chat-like history of user queries.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to apply my NLP and Python skills to a **real-world use case** and build a voice-enabled FAQ chatbot that can be trained with any CSV dataset. This project helped me understand how to integrate **speech recognition**, **text matching**, and a simple web interface using **Streamlit**.
